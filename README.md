This project will allow user login and users will be able to create posts and assign it a specific category.
When you create a post, it will show up on the landing page of the website. Along with the landing page, we will have category pages that will list only the posts associated with the category.

### How To Check Out Branches and Push Code
1. Navigate to our Project Board and find your issue #
2. Go back to terminal and run a 'git checkout -b PostIt-issueNumGoesHere-quick-description'
    * Example: 'git checkout -b PostIt-19-update-readme'
    * ![checkoutBranch](./readmeAssets/1.png)
3. Make your changes
4. When you're ready to commit follow these steps:
    1. Run 'git add .' to add all your changes
    2. Run 'git commit -m "#issueNumber with description of what you did afterwards"'
        * This step is important, if you dont add your issue number then github won't recognize the commit and display the commit message on github
    3. Push your changes 'git push origin branchName'
    * ![pushBranch](./readmeAssets/2.png)
5. If you have any questions or are skeptical about something, ask Jonathan :D
